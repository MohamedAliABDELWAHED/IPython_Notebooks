# Repo of my Jupyter Notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aschleg/IPython_Notebooks/master)

This repository is more or less a central location of my [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) on various topics in hopes of keeping more organized. Some of these notebooks may appear in other projects where appropriate.

## Contents

* finance/
	- Collection of notebooks of some computational financial functions.
* petpy/
	- Vignette notebooks on using my [petpy](https://github.com/aschleg/petpy) library for working with the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs)
* python_excel/
	- Notebooks of using Python with Excel interactively. (Note: may be quite out of date at this point with the new releases of [xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/))
* AAC Shelter Pets Analysis/
	- Series of notebooks that analyze the Austin Animal Center's animal shelter outcomes dataset. A prediction model is built using scikit-learn to predict the outcome of a cat using several data points. 

## Data

The data sets used in the notebooks will be listed here and can be downloaded from S3.
